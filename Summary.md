- ✅ **Hybrid cloud identity** connecting on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft 365
- ✅ **Complete Microsoft 365 tenant** with Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, Intune
- ✅ **Multi-platform ITSM expertise** - osTicket and Jira Service Management

## Problem-Solving Examples (3 minutes)

### **High CPU on Azure VM** 
- **Problem:** Domain controller at 90% CPU, users experiencing slow logins
- **Solution:** Identified Windows Defender scan during business hours, rescheduled to off-hours
- **Result:** 78% CPU reduction (90% → 12%), logins 85% faster

### **Hybrid Identity Sync Failure** 
- **Problem:** New AD users not appearing in Microsoft 365
- **Solution:** Found disabled cloud sync configuration, re-enabled and forced delta sync
- **Result:** All users synced within 2 minutes, zero downtime

### **OneDrive File Recovery** 
- **Problem:** User deleted 25 critical Excel files before client meeting
- **Solution:** Recovered from SharePoint second-stage recycle bin (30-93 day retention)
- **Result:** All files restored in 18 minutes, meeting proceeded successfully

### **Conditional Access Block** 
- **Problem:** Remote user blocked from SharePoint when working from home
- **Solution:** Added home IP to trusted locations, fixed VPN split-tunnel config
- **Result:** Immediate access restored, documented for future remote workers

## Why This Project Stands Out (2 minutes)

### **1. Real-World, Not Theoretical**

- Cloud-first architecture (Azure + M365)
- Modern identity management (Entra Connect Cloud Sync)
- Enterprise ITSM platform (Jira)

### **3. Quantifiable Results**
- 36% faster resolution times
- 92% first-contact resolution
- 100% SLA compliance
- 65% cost optimization

### **4. Complete Documentation**
- 4 knowledge base articles
- Network architecture diagrams
- Step-by-step ticket resolutions
- Lessons learned and best practices
