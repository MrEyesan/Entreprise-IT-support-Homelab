## üé§ Interview Talking Points

### **"Tell me about this project"**

> "I built a complete enterprise IT infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to demonstrate real-world IT support skills. The project includes 3 virtual machines running Windows Server as a domain controller, Windows 10 as a client, and Ubuntu hosting osTicket. I implemented hybrid identity by syncing our on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft 365 using Entra Connect Cloud Sync, which reduced password sync time from 30 minutes to under 5 minutes.
>
> I resolved 25 realistic IT support tickets across two platforms‚ÄîosTicket for traditional help desk scenarios and Jira for cloud-focused issues. My average resolution time was 38.5 minutes, which is 36% faster than the industry standard of 60 minutes, with 100% SLA compliance.
>
> The project demonstrates I can manage Active Directory, troubleshoot Azure infrastructure, administer Microsoft 365, handle hybrid identity, and work with multiple ticketing platforms‚Äîall skills directly applicable to this role."

### **"What was your biggest challenge?"**

> "The biggest challenge was implementing hybrid identity synchronization. Microsoft deprecated the traditional Azure AD Connect tool right as I was trying to use it. Instead of giving up, I researched the modern approach‚ÄîMicrosoft Entra Connect Cloud Sync‚Äîand successfully deployed it.
>
> This actually turned into a win because Cloud Sync reduced password synchronization time by 83%‚Äîfrom 30 minutes down to 2-5 minutes. When users change passwords, they can access Microsoft 365 almost immediately instead of waiting half an hour. I documented this timing to set proper user expectations, which reduces false emergency tickets.
>
> This taught me that staying current with technology changes is crucial, and sometimes the 'obstacle' leads you to a better solution."

### **"How did you demonstrate problem-solving?"**

> "One example is troubleshooting a domain controller running at 90% CPU constantly, causing slow logins for users. I systematically diagnosed the issue:
>
> 1. Checked Task Manager - Windows Defender consuming 85% CPU
> 2. Reviewed scheduled tasks - found full scan scheduled at 2 PM daily during business hours
> 3. Rescheduled scans to 11 PM when users aren't working
> 4. Immediate result: CPU dropped to 12%, login times improved by 85%
>
> I didn't just fix the symptom‚ÄîI implemented preventive measures by documenting maintenance windows and configuring monitoring alerts. This reduced CPU usage by 78% and prevented future user complaints."
