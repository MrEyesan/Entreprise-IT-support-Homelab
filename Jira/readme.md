-  **Mobile device management** (Microsoft Intune)
-  **Security and compliance** (MFA, Conditional Access)

**Platform:** Jira Service Management Cloud (SaaS)  
**Project:** IT Support Desk  
**Site:** homelabIT.atlassian.net  
**Project Key:** ITD
**Tickets Resolved:** 10 with professional documentation

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: Jira vs osTicket

### **Platform Differences**

| Aspect | Jira Service Management | osTicket |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| **Deployment** | SaaS (Cloud) | Self-hosted (Ubuntu LAMP) |
| **Cost** | Free tier (up to 3 agents) | Open-source (free) |
| **Setup Time** | 30 minutes | 2-3 hours |
| **Maintenance** | Managed by Atlassian | Manual (updates, backups) |
| **Scalability** | Unlimited (paid tiers) | Limited by server resources |
| **Integration** | Extensive (Confluence, Bitbucket, etc.) | Limited plugins |
| **Mobile App** | Native iOS/Android apps | Web-only |
| **Reporting** | Advanced dashboards | Basic reports |

### **Ticket Focus Differences**

**Jira Tickets (Modern IT):**
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud infrastructure (Azure VMs)
- üîê Microsoft 365 administration
- üîÑ Hybrid identity management
- üì± Mobile device management
- üîí Security and compliance

**osTicket Tickets (Traditional IT):**
- üñ®Ô∏è Printer troubleshooting
- üíª Local software installations
- üñ•Ô∏è Desktop performance issues
- üåê Network connectivity basics
- üìß Email client configuration

### **Why Both Platforms Matter**

**Strategic Value:**
1. **Versatility** - Demonstrates ability to work with multiple ITSM tools
2. **Adaptability** - Can transition between different ticketing systems
3. **Comprehensive Skills** - Covers both legacy and modern IT environments
4. **Enterprise Readiness** - Shows understanding of SaaS vs self-hosted trade-offs

**Real-World Scenario:**
> Many companies use multiple ticketing systems:
> - Jira for internal IT and development teams
> - Another system (ServiceNow, Zendesk) for external customers
> - Legacy systems still in production
>
> Showing experience with both Jira and osTicket proves you can work in any environment.
